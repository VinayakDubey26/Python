Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

Provides a clear structure to programs
Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Allows you to build reusable applications with less code

A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class

Use the __init__() method to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
